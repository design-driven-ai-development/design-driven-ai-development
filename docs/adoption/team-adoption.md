# Team Adoption Guide

## Overview

Adopting DDAD requires understanding the methodology and establishing the right practices.

## Prerequisites

- Team familiar with design-first principles
- Version control for artifacts
- AI coding tools available
- Management support

## Adoption Steps

### Step 1: Understand DDAD
- Read core concepts
- Understand artifact model
- Learn execution flow

### Step 2: Start Small
- Choose a simple feature
- Create artifacts
- Execute one TODO item
- Review results

### Step 3: Establish Practices
- Standardize artifact formats
- Create templates
- Define review process
- Share learnings

### Step 4: Scale Gradually
- Apply to more features
- Include more team members
- Refine process
- Build expertise

## Key Practices

### 1. Invest in Design
- Quality LLD leads to quality code
- Spend time on artifacts
- Be specific and complete

### 2. Authorize Carefully
- One TODO at a time
- Check dependencies
- Manage scope

### 3. Review Thoroughly
- Review against LLD
- Verify tests
- Ensure quality

### 4. Iterate on Design
- Update LLD based on learnings
- Refine specifications
- Improve continuously

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: Vague LLD
**Solution**: Be specific, include all details, review together

### Challenge: Scope Creep
**Solution**: Use AGENTS.md constraints, one TODO at a time

### Challenge: Review Fatigue
**Solution**: Review against LLD, focus on alignment

## Success Metrics

- Artifact quality improves
- Code matches design
- Review time decreases
- Team satisfaction increases
